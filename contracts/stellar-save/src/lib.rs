//! # Stellar-Save Smart Contract
//! 
//! A decentralized rotational savings and credit association (ROSCA) built on Stellar Soroban.
//! 
//! This contract enables groups to pool funds in a rotating savings system where:
//! - Members contribute a fixed amount each cycle
//! - One member receives the total pool each cycle
//! - The process rotates until all members have received a payout
//! 
//! ## Modules
//! - `events`: Event types for contract state change tracking
//! - `group`: Core Group data structure and state management
//! - `payout`: Payout record tracking for fund distributions
