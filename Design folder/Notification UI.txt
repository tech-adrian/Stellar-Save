Project Overview: Multi-Platform Notification Systems
I designed and implemented comprehensive Notification Centers focused on user engagement and real-time information architecture. My work involved creating scalable components for various alert types, including high-priority actions, transactional confirmations, and system status updates.

Key Features I Developed:
Actionable Alerts: Implemented high-priority "Action Required" cards with embedded CTA buttons (e.g., identity verification) to reduce friction in the user journey.

Transactional Transparency: Designed clear success states for financial contributions and profile updates, providing users with immediate peace of mind.

Social & System Integration: Built components for social triggers (e.g., "New Member Joined") and critical system maintenance logs.

Filtering & Organization: Developed a tabbed navigation system (All, Unread, Archive) to help users manage information density effectively.

Visual Hierarchy: Utilized distinct iconography and color-coding to differentiate between security alerts, financial milestones, and general updates.

Impact & Design Logic
"The goal was to move beyond a simple list and create a dynamic communication hub. By categorizing notifications by time (Today, Yesterday) and priority level, I improved the scannability of the interface, ensuring users never miss a critical security alert or a 'Goal Achieved' celebration."
