Save Smart, Reach for the Stars
I started with the wireframe design in Figma for these automated tools, focusing on a high-contrast interface to help you reach your financial goals faster with zero effort.

Why Stellar-Save?
Automated Rules: I worked on the original Figma wireframes for these features. I made the design decision to use clean, card-based layouts to separate "Smart Rounding" from "Recurring Transfers," making the automation feel manageable.

Goal Tracking: I designed the initial layouts for the intuitive dashboards. I pushed for increased whitespace and simplified vector icons in Figma to ensure your progress remains the focal point of the screen.

Safe & Secure: I worked on the UX flow for bank-level security. I chose a minimalist "Vault" icon and bold typography to build immediate trust the moment a user lands on the page.

How It Works
Connect Account: I started with the wireframe design for the secure bridge. In Figma, I opted for a vertical "1-2-3" stepped flow with bright green focal points to guide users through the connection process in under 60 seconds.

Set Your Goals: I worked on the interface design that lets you define your "Why." I kept the input fields simple—like a car or a rainy day fund—to reduce cognitive load during the onboarding experience.

Watch it Grow: I designed the user experience for the AI. I used Figma to transition from the high-energy green theme to a sophisticated dark-mode "Premium" aesthetic for the final dashboard to emphasize wealth and stability.
