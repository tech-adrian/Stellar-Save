A high-fidelity UI design for a mobile 'Header Wallet' or 'Head Wallet' management screen, following a premium dark-mode aesthetic with neon green accents. The interface features a prominent 'Total Portfolio Balance' header at the top, followed by a sleek 'Switch Wallet' dropdown menu. Below the header, there are interactive cards for different sub-wallets (e.g., 'Primary Head', 'Secondary Vault') showing real-time ETH and BTC balances with sparkline graphs. The design includes 'Send', 'Receive', and 'Swap' quick-action buttons with clean iconography. The layout is modern, minimalist, and uses glassmorphism effects for the cards. High resolution, 4k, professional fintech app design.
