Think of the Style Guide as the visual dictionary. it is static and focuses on the aesthetic standards. It tells you what to use so the brand stays recognizable.

Color Palettes: Primary, secondary, and accent colors (HEX/RGB codes).

Typography: Which fonts to use for headers vs. body text.

Iconography: The specific style of icons (line art vs. solid).

Brand Voice: The tone of the copy (is it witty or formal?).

Logo Usage: Where it goes and—more importantly—where it shouldn’t go.

🏗️ The Design System (The "Source of Truth")
The Design System is the entire infrastructure. It includes the Style Guide but adds the "how-to" and the actual code. It’s a library of reusable components that allows a team to build products at scale.

Component Library: Ready-to-use UI elements like buttons, form fields, and nav bars.

Design Tokens: Variables (like $brand-blue) that sync design files with code.

Pattern Library: Best practices for layouts (e.g., how a login flow should behave).

Documentation: Clear instructions on why certain elements are used in specific contexts.
